            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a recent graduate from Marquette University with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering. 
                Through completing projects I have gained experience in Object-Oriented programming,
                Java, and C. With various courses, I have been learned to use SQL, HTML, and CSS on various assignments.
                With my current technical knowledge and exposure, I am looking for a entry-level position as a Software Engineer, Software Analyst,
            Software Tester, or Quality Assurance Analyst. I truly believe my current skill set and drive to learn will make me suitable for any of these roles.</p>
